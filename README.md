[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess)

Let's build a decentralized chess tournament using GitHub and Travis CI.

Fork this, modify engine, and let's battle!

The idea isn't to modify stockfish, it's to write clever short python algorithms. Will add checks for running time and code shortness soon.
