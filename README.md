# battlechess

### A decentralized chess tournament using GitHub and Travis CI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess)

Currently, the engine makes random moves. Fork this, modify get_move in engine.py, and join the battle!

The idea isn't to modify stockfish, it's to write clever short python algorithms. Will add checks for running time and code shortness soon. If you want to use a Python library, send a pull request and I'll decide if it's fair.
